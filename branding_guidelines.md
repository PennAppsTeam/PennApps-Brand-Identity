# Logo

The PennApps logo is the primary asset of the PennApps brand and should never be altered when used.

For compactness, a thumbnail version of the logo is also available.

The logo should always be surrounded with clear space, that is at a minimum, proportional to the width of ascender in the 'p' in 'pennapps'.

# Colors

PennApps uses four colors in its visual identity:

* White, #FFFFFF
* Black, #000000
* Red, #D80000
* Blue, #0070FF

# Typography

The "pennapps" brand uses the Coolvetica font.

# Copy

When describing PennApps, refrain from referring to it as a "hackathon". Instead, use the term "application development competition".
